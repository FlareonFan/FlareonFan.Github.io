    Zoey:<br>
       Harry's sister and the object of Tom's affection.<br>
       Zoey is a smart and capable young girl who wants to keep both her brother and Tom safe during the events of the game. Her preferred weapon of choice is her water pistol but she
       also uses her paddle ball to deal damage when enemies tend to get too close. She tries to keep the team motivated and focused on the task at hand.
   </span></a>   <a class=info><img src="photos/T.png" width="100" height="100"><span>Tom:<br>
       Harry's best friend and apparently has a crush on Zoey.<br>
       Tom is the tougher of the three who prefers to use his baseball bat to fend off
       the monsters. For every 50 points of damage Tom suffers, he will take five less damage up to
       fifty percent and for his special move, 'Sugar Rush', he will give everyone candy to help make them
       move faster for a set amount of time.

   </span></a>   <a class=info><img src="photos/H.png" width="100" height="100"><span> Harry:<br>
       Zoey's brother and Tom's best friend.<br>
       Harry is a boy genius and a master of technology whom builds
       weapons and other gadgets out of items found around the house. He hopes
       these items can be used to fight the monsters terrorizing them. Harry's choice of
       weapon is his slingshot through he can upgrade this to a stronger version after defeating a set amount
       of monsters three times and will lose this if he ends up being knocked out.

<h3> <br>Meet Zoey, Tom and Harry.<br>
    During their sleepover, Harry and Tom thought it was going to be all fun and games like a normal sleepover till the
    truth emerges that there's things that do go bump in the night - and these things are not interested in playing nice
    either.<br>
    Team up with up to two other players or play solo to help Tom, Harry and Zoe to face and defeat all their foes so
    things can turn back to normal and end the night terrors once and for all.<p>
    </h3>
    
    Update - will be redoing this to showcase phaser projects for my porfolio.
